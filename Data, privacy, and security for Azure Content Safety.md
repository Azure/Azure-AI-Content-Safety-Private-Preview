Data, privacy, and security for Azure Content Safety
This article provides details regarding how data provided by you to Azure Content Safety is processed, used, and stored. Azure Content Safety stores and processes data to provide the service, to monitor for uses that violate the applicable product terms. Please also see the Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum, which governs data processing by Azure Content Safety except as otherwise provided in the applicable Product Terms.
Azure Content Safety was designed with compliance, privacy, and security in mind; however, the customer is responsible for its use and the implementation of this technology.

Data provided to us to improve your use of the Service
You may (but do not need to) provide us with real examples of your content with which you are using Azure Content Safety and/or examples of content and associated predictive severity levels (“Sample Content”). If you choose to provide us with this data, we may manually review them solely to (1) improve your experience with the Azure Content Safety and (2) improve the quality of the Azure Content Safety service. 
If you provide Sample Content to us:  
•  You agree that you will not include any personal, confidential, or commercially sensitive information in the Sample Content you send us. 
•  You consent to permit authorized engineers, data scientists, and project teams (collectively, “Reviewers”) from Microsoft to manually review the Sample Content to build, improve, and validate the machine learning models for Azure Content Safety (“Improvements”).  We will review the Sample Content to improve the customer experience with better machine learning implementations. Manual review of the Sample Content is needed to achieve that outcome. You may revoke your consent to our human review of your Sample Content at any time by giving the project manager working with you written notice, and we will delete the Sample Content from our systems promptly upon receipt of such notice. 
•  The project manager working with you will provide instructions for sending any Sample Content you choose  to  provide  to  us.  Only Reviewers with permissions will be able to access  and  view your  Sample Content, solely for the purposes described here, and such Reviewers will only use secure workstations to do so. 
•  As between you and Microsoft: (a) all Sample Content remains yours and (b) all Improvements, and any work product or developments (such as coding or documentation) resulting from Microsoft’s use of Sample Content, will be owned by Microsoft. In addition, all Sample Content will remain your Confidential Information and all Improvements will remain Microsoft’s Confidential Information.  
How is data retained and what customer controls are available?
Azure Content Safety works to filter harmful content. This system works by running the input through an ensemble of classification models. Once a customer's Azure Content Safety resource is created, you can submit text and images to the model through the REST API, client libraries, or the Azure Content Safety Studio; the model generates outputs that are returned through the API.
No input texts or images are stored in the model during detection processes (except for customer-supplied blocklists, as discussed below), and user inputs are not used to train, retrain or improve the Azure Content Safety models.
•	Blocklist data. The Blocklist API allows customers to upload their block items for the purpose of supplementing the Azure Content Safety model. Block Item data is stored in Azure Storage, encrypted at rest by Microsoft Managed keys, within the same region as the resource and logically isolated with the customer’s Azure subscription and API Credentials. Uploaded items can be deleted by the user via the DELETE API operation. Block Items are not used to improve the Azure Content Safety Models.

Is customer data processed by Azure Content Safety leaves Azure Content Safety?
No. Microsoft hosts the Azure Content Safety models within our Azure infrastructure. All customer data sent to Azure Content Safety remains within Azure Content Safety and in the region you chose and will not be transmitted to other regions.
Is customer data used to train the Azure Content Safety models?
No. We do not use customer data to train, retrain or improve the models in Azure Content Safety.
