The Ungroundedness (Hallucination) Detection API detects ungroundedness generated by the large language models (LLMs). Ungroundedness refers to instances where the LLMs produce information that is non-factual or inaccurate from what was present in the source materials provided by the users.

##  üóÉKey Features
- **Domain Selection**: This feature offers a selection of specific domains, such as medical, generic, etc., pre-defined by AACS. Users can choose from these established domains to ensure more tailored detection that aligns with the specific needs of their chosen field.
- **Task Specification**: Supports different tasks such as QnA (Questioning & Answering) and Summarization, with adjustable settings according to the task types.
- **Speed vs Interpretability**:
  > - Non-Reasoning mode: Offers fast detection capability, easy to embed into online applications.
  > - Reasoning mode: Offers detailed explanation for detected ungrounded segments easy for understanding and mitigation.

##  üìí Overview 

This documentation site is structured into the following sections.

- **Concepts** This section offers a deep dive into the fundamental principles and theories underlying the Hallucination (Ungroundedness) API. It covers key concepts such as the definition of 'ungroundedness' in the context of AI-generated content.
- **Tasks** provide comprehensive details about the various tasks the API can perform.
- **QuickStart** step-by-step instructions to help users begin making requests to the service efficiently.
- **Sample Code** demonstrates practical usage with examples in cURL, Python, C#, and Java.

  

##  üóÉConcepts

- **Groundedness and Ungroundedness in LLMs**: This refers to the extent to which the model‚Äôs outputs are based on provided information or reflect reliable sources accurately. A grounded response adheres closely to the given information, avoiding speculation or fabrication. In groundedness measures, source information is crucial and serves as the grounding source. 

- **Hallucination in LLMs**: Hallucination involves generating text that contains fabricated, false, or misleading information. Hallucination in LLMs is a broader concept that generally includes ungroundedness but goes a step further. It refers to the generation of text that is not just ungrounded, but also fabricated, false, or misleading. Hallucination encompasses a wider range of inaccuracies, including completely made-up information that may not have any basis in the provided data or known facts.

- **Ungroundedness as a Subset of Hallucination**: While all hallucinated content is ungrounded, not all ungrounded content is a hallucination. Hallucination is a broader term that includes any kind of fabricated or false information, whereas ungroundedness specifically refers to deviations from provided information or known facts.

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model‚Äôs cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Please see more datails on [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/).

##  üóÉTasks

The current Ungroundedness (Hallucination) Detection API supports both text-based Summarization and Questioning & Answering (QnA) tasks to ensure that the generated summaries or answers are accurate and reliable.  Here are some examples:

**Summarization Tasks**:  
- Medical summarization: In the context of medical news articles, the function can be utilized to ensure that the summary does not contain fabricated or misleading information, guaranteeing that readers obtain accurate and reliable medical information.
- Academic paper summarization: When generating summaries of academic papers or research articles, the function can help ensure that the summarized content accurately represents the key findings and contributions without introducing false claims.<br>
- Legal document summarization: In legal environments, where summarizing lengthy legal documents is common, the function can confirm that the summary does not contain any erroneous statements or omissions that could lead to legal disputes.<br>

**QnA (Questioning & Answering) Tasks**:
- Customer support chatbots: In customer support, the function can be used to validate the answers provided by AI chatbots, ensuring that customers receive accurate and trustworthy information when they ask questions about products or services.
- Medical QnA: For medical QnA, the function assists in verifying the accuracy of medical answers and advice provided by AI systems to healthcare professionals and patients, reducing the risk of medical errors.
- Educational QnA: In educational settings, the function can be applied to QnA tasks to confirm that answers to academic questions or test prep queries are factually accurate, supporting the learning process.
- Financial and investment queries: For financial and investment-related questions, the function can validate the answers given by AI systems, helping users make informed financial decisions based on accurate information.

## üí°QuickStart 
### Step 1. Whitelist your subscription ID

1. Submit this form by filling your subscription ID to whitelist this feature to you: [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/r/38GYZwLC0u).
2. The whitelist will take up to 48 hours to approve. Once you receive notification from Microsoft, you can go to next step.

### Step 2. Create an Azure Content Safety resource

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. [Create Content Safety Resource](https://aka.ms/acs-create). Enter a unique name for your resource, select the **whitelisted subscription**, resource group, region and pricing tier. Currently this private preview Hallucination(Ungroundedness) Detection API is only available in three regions: **East US2, West US, Sweden Central**. Please create your Content Safety resource in these regions.
3. **The resource will take a few minutes to deploy.** After it does, go to the new resource. To access your Content Safety resource, you'll need a subscription key; in the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **API Keys and Endpoints**. Copy one of the subscription key values and endpoint for later use.


### Step 3. Test with sample Request

Now that you have a resource available in Azure for Content Safety and you have a subscription key for that resource, let's run some tests by using the Hallucination(Ungroundedness) Detection API.

**Language availability**
Currently, the Hallucination (Ungroundedness) API supports the English language. While our API does not restrict the submission of non-English content, we cannot guarantee the same level of quality and accuracy in the analysis of such content. The API is optimized for English, and using languages other than English may result in suboptimal performance. We recommend users to primarily submit content in English to ensure the most reliable and accurate results from the API.

**Text length limitations**
Please note that the maximum character limit for the grounding sources is 55K characters, and for the text, it is 7.5K characters for each API call. If your input (either text or grounding sources) exceeds these character limitations per API call, you will encounter an error.

#### Call the REST API.

1. Substitute the `<endpoint>` with your resource endpoint URL (skip the ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù in the URL).
2. Replace `<your_subscription_key>` with your key.


Our Hallucination Detection API provides the option to include reasoning in the API response. If you opt for reasoning, you must either utilize your own GPT resources or use our provided default GPT resources. In this case, the response will include an additional reasoning value. This value details specific instances and explanations for any detected ungroundedness. If you choose not to receive reasoning, the API will classify the submitted content as true or false and provide a confidence score.

        "I'm 21 years old and I need to make a decision about the next two years of my life. Within a week. I currently work for a bank that requires strict sales goals to meet. IF they aren't met three times (three months) you're canned. They pay me 10/hour and it's not unheard of to get a raise in 6ish months. The issue is, **I'm not a salesperson**. That's not my personality. I'm amazing at customer service. I have the most positive customer service \"reports\" done about me in the short time I've worked here. A coworker asked \"do you ask for people to fill these out? You have a ton\". That being said, I have a job opportunity at Chase Bank as a part time teller. What makes this decision so hard is that at my current job, I get 40 hours and Chase could only offer me 20 hours/week. Drive time to my current job is also 21 miles **one way** while Chase is literally 1.8 miles from my house, allowing me to go home for lunch. I do have an apartment and an awesome roommate that I know wont be late on his portion of rent, so paying bills with 20 hours a week isn't the issue. It's the spending money and being broke all the time.\n\nI previously worked at Wal-Mart and took home just about 400 dollars every other week. So I know i can survive on this income. I just don't know whether I should go for Chase as I could definitely see myself having a career there. I'm a math major likely going to become an actuary, so Chase could provide excellent opportunities for me **eventually**.",
