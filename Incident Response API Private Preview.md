# Incident Response API Private Preview Documentation ![informational](https://shields.io/badge/-PrivatePreview-PrivatePreview)

Incident response in content moderation scenario is the process of identifying, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cyber incidents that involve inappropriate or harmful content on online platforms. For any new incidents, users could use the incident response features from Azure AI Content Safety to mitigate the new incidents quickly.

Incident response provides a set of APIs to help users mitigate incidents within short time, [Blocklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/how-to/use-blocklist) as one solution of that but only provides with exact match, this new release we are bringing in advanced capabilities for text semantic match, and image matching capability.

For this advanced text and image incident response, you could easily define an incident with few samples which are under one specific topic, and similar content will be detected in analyze API. 

Note: This new feature is only available in **East US** and **Sweden Central**. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

The sample code could have offensive content, user discretion is advised.

## üìí Overview

- **How It Works** contains instructions for using the service in more general ways.
- **Quick start** shows sample requests using the cURL, Python of how to create an incident, add samples and inference with the created incident list.
- **Limitations** goes over the limitations of this feature.
- **Sample code** shows sample requests using the cURL, Python of other incident management related APIs.

## How it works
An incident may involve a set of emerging content patterns (text, image, and other modalities) that violates the Microsoft community guidelines or customers policies and expectations, that need to be mitigated quickly and accurately to avoid potential live site issue or harm to users/communities. 

Existing incident response have some pain points such as false positives, missed content, difficulty of management and complexity on writing patterns, also lack the ability to detect image related incidents.

Azure AI Content Safety is building up a robust incident response system to mitigate incident promptly and reduce maintenance effort largely, which covers both text and image.

For text, besides literal match, we are developing semantic match using embedding search and a lightweight classifier to mitigate a broader semantic space, addressing potential new harms as they arise.

For image, we are developing a light-weight image object tracking model and embedding search to address image incidents with low latency and high performance.


## Quick start

### Step 1. Whitelist your subscription ID

1. Submit this form by filling in your subscription ID to whitelist this feature to you: [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/r/38GYZwLC0u).
2. The whitelist will take up to 48 hours to approve. Once you receive a notification from Microsoft, you can go to the next step.

### Step 2. Create an Azure Content Safety resource

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. [Create Content Safety Resource](https://aka.ms/acs-create). Enter a unique name for your resource, select the **whitelisted subscription**, resource group, and your preferred region in one of the **East US, Sweden Central** and pricing tier. Select **Create**.
3. **The resource will take a few minutes to deploy.** After it does, go to the new resource. To access your Content Safety resource, you'll need a subscription key; In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **API Keys and Endpoints**. Copy one of the subscription key values and endpoint for later use.

### Step 3A. Test with Sample request of text incident response

#### 1. Create an incident

```shell
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://<endpoint>/contentsafety/text/incidents/text-incident-name?api-version=2023-10-30-preview' \
--header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <api_key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "incidentName": "text-incident-name",
  "description": "string"
}'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://<endpoint>/contentsafety/text/incidents/text-incident-name?api-version=2023-10-30-preview"

payload = json.dumps({
  "incidentName": "text-incident-name",
  "description": "string"
})
headers = {
  'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<api_key>',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("PATCH", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

#### 2. Add samples to the incident
