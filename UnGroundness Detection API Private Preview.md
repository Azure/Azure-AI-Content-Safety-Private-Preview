The ungroundedness detection API is designed to identify instances of ungrounded information generated by GPTx or other large language models. Ungroundedness refers to situations where the model produces false or fictional information that does not align with user provided information and context. Ungroundedness mitigation includes a holistic set of approaches:
Approach Description
A.	Metapromt Engineering	Craft prompts for an LLM model to guide it into generating a desired output.
B.	Detection or Annotation	Annotate where ungroundedness occurs.
C.	Reasoning	Provide an explanation why the ungroundedness is annotated based on the source information.
D.	Rewriting or Recommendation	If the ungroundedness content is replaced, what will be the recommended content. 
E.	Monitoring	Monitor the detection results and generate reports and insights accordingly.
F.	Evaluation and Solution Iteration 	Evaluate LLM performance.  Iterate and enhance the solution.

This API covers the Approaches “B”, “C” and “D”.  We will have future update to cover other areas.

### Tasks

The current ungroundedness detection and mitigation function supports both text-based summarization and questioning & answering (QA) tasks to ensure that the generated summaries or answers are accurate and reliable.  Here are some examples:

**Summarization Tasks**:  
•	News summarization: In the context of news articles, the function can be used to verify that the summary does not include fabricated or misleading information, ensuring that readers receive accurate and trustworthy information.
•	Academic paper summarization: When generating summaries of academic papers or research articles, the function can help ensure that the summarized content accurately represents the key findings and contributions without introducing false claims.
•	Legal document summarization: In legal environments, where summarizing lengthy legal documents is common, the function can confirm that the summary does not contain any erroneous statements or omissions that could lead to legal disputes.

**Questioning-Answering (QA) Tasks**: 
•	Customer support chatbots: In customer support, the function can be used to validate the answers provided by AI chatbots, ensuring that customers receive accurate and trustworthy information when they ask questions about products or services.
•	Legal queries: For legal QA systems, the function helps verify the accuracy of legal answers and advice provided by AI systems to lawyers and clients, reducing the risk of legal complications.
•	Educational QA: In educational settings, the function can be applied to QA tasks to confirm that answers to academic questions or test prep queries are factually accurate, supporting the learning process.
•	Financial and investment queries: For financial and investment-related questions, the function can validate the answers given by AI systems, helping users make informed financial decisions based on accurate information.


### Concepts
Groundedness Definition
Groundedness in LLMs refers to the degree to which the model's outputs are based on given information or how accurately the outputs reflect reliable sources.  A grounded response is the one that sticks closely to given information and avoids speculation or fabrication.  In groundedness measures, source information is required and serves as the grounding source.    

Ungroundedness differs from hallucination in LLMs.  Hallucination in LLMs refers to the generation of text that contains information that is fabricated, false, or misleading.  The definition of LLM hallucination varies among technical communities, but in general grounding source is optional rather than required for hallucination evaluation.

Some LLM outputs could be non-hallucinated but ungrounded.  An example could be:
An online shopping platform ShopSphere had been implementing 30 days return policy for 3 years.  Recently ShopSphere introduced premium membership with $50 per year membership fee.  If a customer is a premium member, the customer has up to 180 days to return merchandise.

If ShopSphere provides the most recent return policy and membership information, optimal LLM outputs would provide customized answers about the return policy based on the membership status (non-premium members for 30 days, versus premium member for 180 days).  These answers are both non-hallucinated and grounded. However, if the answer is simply 30 days for all members, the answer is ungrounded, but not necessarily hallucinated.

Ungroundedness detection and mitigation are in scope, while hallucination detection is out of scope for our product offerings.


## 💡 QuickStart - Ungroundedness Detection Detection by using the API 

Before you can begin to test, you need to create an Azure AI Content Safety resource and get the subscription keys to access the resource.

> ###  📘 NOTE:
>
> The samples could contain offensive content, user discretion advised!!


### Step 1. Whitelist your subscription ID

1. Submit this form by filling your subscription ID to whitelist this feature to you: [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/r/38GYZwLC0u).
2. The whitelist will take up to 48 hours to approve. Once you receive notification from Microsoft, you can go to next step.

### Step 2. Create an Azure Content Safety resource

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. [Create Content Safety Resource](https://aka.ms/acs-create). Enter a unique name for your resource, select the **whitelisted subscription**, resource group, your preferred region in one of the **East US, West Europe** and pricing tier. Select **Create**.
3. **The resource will take a few minutes to deploy.** After it does, go to the new resource. To access your Content Safety resource, you'll need a subscription key; In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **API Keys and Endpoints**. Copy one of the subscription key values and endpoint for later use.

> ###  📘 NOTE:
>
> Currently the private preview features are only available in two regions:  **East US, West Europe**. Please create your Content Safety resource in these regions. Feel free to let us know your future production regions so we can plan accordingly.

### Step 3. Test with sample Request

Now that you have a resource available in Azure for Content Safety and you have a subscription key for that resource, let's run some tests by using the Ungroundedness Detection API.

#### Prepare a sample text and grounding sources 

Choose a sample text to analyze.

We support JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, or WEBP image formats. The maximum size for image submissions is 4 MB, and image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 2,048 x 2,048 pixels. If your format is animated, we will extract the first frame to do the detection.

#### **Request Format Reference**

1. Substitute the `<endpoint>` with your resource endpoint URL.
2. Replace `<your_subscription_key>` with your key.
3. Populate the `"image"` field in the body with either a `"content"` field or a `"blobUrl"` field. For example: `{"image": {"content": "<base_64_string>"}` or `{"image": {"blobUrl": "<your_storage_url>"}`.

```
curl --location '<Endpoint>contentsafety/text:detectUngroundedness?api-version=2023-11-30-preview' \
--header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your_subscription_key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "Task": "Summarization",
    "Text": "The sun rises from the west. In most cultures and scientific understanding, the sun rises in the west, traverses the sky throughout the day, and sets in the west. This is a result of the Earth'\''s rotation, which gives the impression of the sun'\''s apparent movement across the sky. However, in some ancient myths, legends, or cultural beliefs, there might exist different interpretations. ",

    ]
